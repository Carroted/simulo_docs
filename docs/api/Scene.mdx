# Scene

The `Scene` global provides fields and functions relating to the Simulo scene.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
:::

---

---

### \:add_attachment()

Adds a new attachment to the scene. They can either be attached to objects or to the background.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_attachment({
    parent = nil, -- attached to background / scene
    local_position = vec2(0, 1), -- usually relative to object, but in this case is world position since on background
    local_angle = 0.1,
    -- optionally, we can add images (you don't need images field)
    images = {
        {
            -- We only need the texture, every other field in `images` is optional and has the defaults you'd expect.
            texture = require('core/assets/textures/point_light.png'),
            
            color = 0xffa0a0,
            offset = vec2(0.5, 0.5),
            angle = 0.1,
            flip_x = false,
            flip_y = true,
            filtering = "linear", -- change to "nearest" for pixel art, otherwise it'll be blurry
            scale = vec2(1.1, 1.1),
        },
    },
    -- we can also optionally add lights
    lights = {
        {
            -- These don't have defaults
            intensity = 1,
            radius = 0.5,
            color = 0xffffff,

            -- But these do:
            falloff = 0.3,
            offset = vec2(0.5, 0.5),
        },
    },
    -- optional text too
    texts = {
        {
            -- We need at least content if we want text
            content = "Hii omg",

            -- But the rest have defaults
            color = 0xffa0a0,
            offset = vec2(0.5, 0.5),
            angle = 0.4,
            font_size = 1,
            font_resolution = 20,
            
            -- can't set font yet! sorry
        },
    },
    use_world_angle = false, -- this isn't finished and is somewhat broken (you can still try it) but it makes local angle use world instead of relative to parent

    -- everything has defaults fr

    -- other than this. to know how use that, look at `add_component_def` docs, on this same page
    component = {
        name = "Attachment type name, like Hinge, just, the name of your thing",
        version = "0.1.0",
        id = "@you/package/the_the",
        properties = {
            something = {
                name = "Something idk",
                input_type = "slider",
                default_value = 100,
                min_value = 0,
                max_value = 200,
            },
        },
    },
    -- the attachment component is a special type of component
    -- where it is part of attachment itself and cant be removed
    -- and in UI it shows up Above components list
});
```

---

### \:add_spring()

Adds a new spring to the scene. It can be between two objects, or between an object and the background.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_spring({
    object_a = box,
    object_b = nil, -- one end on background
    rest_length = 5,
    stiffness = 10,
    damping = 0.3,
    local_anchor_b = vec2(0, 0.5), -- since object B is background, this is world space
    -- we could also set local_anchor_a
    collide_connected = false, -- defaults to `true` on springs
    attachment = attachment, -- attachment to attach spring to
});
```

---

### \:add_hinge()

Adds a new hinge to the scene. It can be between two objects, or between an object and the background.

You should typically use the `core` `hinge` function instead, since if you use `Scene:add_hinge`, there won't be a visible bolt the user can remove. On the other hand, `core`'s `hinge` adds same thing as the hinge tool. You can even make it invisible if you want.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_hinge({
    object_a = box,
    object_b = nil, -- one end on background
    motor_enabled = true,
    motor_speed = 0.3,
    max_motor_torque = 10,
    local_anchor_b = vec2(0, 0.5), -- since object B is background, this is world space
    -- we could also set local_anchor_a and collide_connected
    attachment = attachment, -- attachment to attach hinge to
});
```

---

### \:reset()

Resets the scene to the default state, adding a ground and all that

---

### \:clear()

Clears the scene, removing all objects and attachments, but keeping the background color and ambient light etc

---

### \:add_bolt()

Adds a new bolt to the scene. It can be between two objects, or between an object and the background.

You should typically use the `core` `bolt` function instead, since if you use `Scene:add_bolt`, there won't be a visible bolt the user can remove. On the other hand, `core`'s `bolt` adds same thing as the bolt tool. You can even make it invisible if you want.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_bolt({
    object_a = box,
    object_b = nil, -- one end on background
    local_anchor_a = vec2(0.5, 0.5),
    local_anchor_b = vec2(1, 0), -- since object B is background, this is world space
    reference_angle = 0.1, -- what difference in angle should there be between the two after bolt
    attachment = attachment, -- attachment to attach bolt to
});
```

---

### \:add_fixed_joint()

Adds a new fixed joint to the scene. It can be between two objects, or between an object and the background.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_fixed_joint({
    object_a = box,
    object_b = nil, -- one end on background
    local_anchor_b = vec2(0, 0.5), -- since object B is background, this is world space
    -- we could also set local_anchor_a and collide_connected
    attachment = attachment, -- attachment to attach fixed joint to
});
```

---

### \:add_audio()

Adds an audio player to the scene. Wow!

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_audio({
    position = vec2(0, 0),
    asset = "path/to/audio.ogg",
    -- we can also set pitch and volume but they default to 1
    -- we can also omit position since it defaults to 0,0
});
```

---

    color = Color:rgb(1, 0.1, 0.1), -- red
});
```

---

### \:add_circle()

Adds a new object to the scene with a circle shape.

#### Example

```lua
Scene:add_circle({
    position = vec2(0, 0),
    radius = 1, -- meters

    color = Color:rgb(1, 0.1, 0.1), -- red
});
```

---

### \:push_undo()

Add an entry to the undo history of the scene. Tools should do this *after* any changes to the scene.

#### Example

-- Now let us save this glorious achievement for the future generations.

Scene:push_undo();

-- Now when they CTRL+Z itll that.
```

---

### \:get_player()

### \:raycast()

I forgot how explain what raycast is but its super useful. Its like a laser and itll tell you what it hits

#### Example
```lua
local hits = Scene:raycast({
    origin = vec2(0, 0), -- where to start the ray
    direction = vec2(1, 1), -- direction of the ray, itll be normalized probably
    distance = 1000, -- how long before it gives up on everything in life
    closest_only = true, -- if false it should get the everything along the way (nothing is tested in this insane game)
});

-- each hit is a table, it has:
--   - object
--   - point (vec2)
--   - normal (vec2, like the reflection of the ray on the surface it hit)
--   - fraction (how far along the distance the hit was, from 0 to 1)
```

---

        -- the ID of the property (used to access it) is here
        health = {
            -- Display name, seen in right-click
            name = "Health",
            -- We support "slider", "text", "color", and "toggle". Soon we will have way more
            input_type = "slider",

            -- For sliders, these are the settings
            default_value = 100,
            min_value = 0,
            max_value = 200,

            -- For color, we have just `default_value`
            -- For text, we have `default_value` and `multi_line` (set it to true or false)
            -- For toggles it's just `default_value`.

            -- There's also "button" input type, untested though. It has just `event` field, it'l call `:send_event` on the object. Get that from `on_event` in your components
