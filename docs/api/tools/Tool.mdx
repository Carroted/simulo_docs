# Tool

This is the `self` in tool scripts.

It provides a Lua API for getting input, setting properties, and interacting with the scene.

You can make custom tools by creating a package and making `tools` folder and making tool folders in there. Check the `core` package for example, the tools have a `tool.toml`.

Drag tool is great sample to look at since it has tool settings. Functions below can help you read tool settings from the tool script. Good luck bestie, you can always ask for help in the server land.
