# Overlays

In tools, we have an `Overlays` global. It only has an `:add` function, with no arguments.

Overlays allow tools to draw previews, like the box tool shows a translucent box while you're drawing it. The drag tool also uses overlays for its drag line.

In multiplayer, Simulo takes care of only sending overlay updates 32 times per second, so things don't start lagging by sending too much.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error

### \:add()

Add a new overlay. Run this directly in tool code, not in `RemoteScene:run` code. It returns a [`LocalOverlay`](/api/tools/LocalOverlay).

#### Example
```lua
local overlay = Overlays:add();
```
