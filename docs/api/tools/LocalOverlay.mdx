# LocalOverlay

If you want to create your own tool with a fancy preview of what it will do, your overlay is your best friend.

Add these with `Overlays:add()` in a tool. You won't be managing overlays from `RemoteScene:run`, but instead directly in your tool ccde. So that means, both *adding** and **updating** your overlays will take place entirely in the tool itself.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
