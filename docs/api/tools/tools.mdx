# Tools

All of Simulo's built-in tools are made in Lua, and you can make your own in the same way.

For some examples, look in [`core` package](/api/core), it has the built-in tools.

To make your own, first:

- Go in Simulo folder (you can use **File** → **Open Simulo Folder** in-game)
- Go in `tools` folder there

Now, in there, make a folder. You should pick a nice lowercase name, with underscores instead of spaces, like `my_tool`.

Next, add a new file there named `tool.toml`. If you're on Windows, you'll need to enable viewing file extensions, see [this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/common-file-name-extensions-in-windows-da4a4430-8e76-89c5-59f7-1cdbbc75cb01). If you're on Mac, use [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp2304/mac).

Put this in the file:
```toml
[tool]
name = "Cool Name"
version = "0.1.0"
```

Now make a `src` folder, and put in a `main.lua`. Inside it, put this:
```lua
function on_update()
    if self:pointer_just_pressed() then
        RemoteScene:run({
            input = self:pointer_pos(),
            code = [[
                Scene:add_box({ position = input });
            ]],
        });
    end;
end;
```

If you've been using components, you might be like "Woah Woah What the Heck is that Whats a RemoteScene what". Don't worry, we have a page for that in the sidebar.

Anyways go in **File** → **Packages** → **Refresh** and Toolbar Editor should open and show your tool with a question mark icon.

You can put in a pretty 128x128px white transparent icon in the tool folder named `icon.png` to make it look nicer, but you'll need restart Simulo to see new icon.

## Tool Settings How?

Just add this at the end of the `tool.toml`:
```toml
[[property]]
id = "box_size"

name = "Box Size"

input_type = "slider"

default_value = 1.0
min_value = 0.1
max_value = 10.0
```

Now, in `main.lua`, replace this part:

```diff
-         RemoteScene:run({
-             input = self:pointer_pos(),
-             code = [[
-                 Scene:add_box({ position = input });
-             ]],
-         });
+         RemoteScene:run({
+             input = {
+                 point = self:pointer_pos(),
+                 size = self:get_property("box_size).value,
+             },
+             code = [[
+                 Scene:add_box({
+                     position = input.point,
+                     size = input.size,
+                 });
+             ]],
+         });
```

Sorry for all the plus signs but it makes the nice green effect. Maybe if you type it yourself you'll remember it better and learn faster.

Anyway refresh again and BAM, it umm yeah.
