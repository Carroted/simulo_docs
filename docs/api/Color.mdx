# Color

The `Color` API is used to represent and work with RGBA colors in Simulo. We don't use `0-255` but rather `0-1` for color components.

A `Color` global is provided with fields and functions to work with colors, but the term `Color` is also used to refer to the <Type name="color" /> type.

## Constructor

To create a <Type name="color" />, we have several options:
```lua
local red = Color:rgb(1, 0, 0); -- or rgba, with an extra 1 at the end
local red = Color:hsv(0, 1, 1); -- or hsva, with an extra 1 at the end
local red = Color:hex(0xff0000);
local red = 0xff0000;
```

## Fields

---

### .r

The red component of the <Type name="color" />. Is a <Type name="number" /> from `0` to `1`.

---

### .g

The green component of the <Type name="color" />. Is a <Type name="number" /> from `0` to `1`.

---

### .b

The blue component of the <Type name="color" />. Is a <Type name="number" /> from `0` to `1`.

---

### .a

The alpha (opacity) component of the <Type name="color" />. Is a <Type name="number" /> from `0` to `1`.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
:::

---

### \:get_hex()

Convert the <Type name="color" /> into a <Type name="number" /> like `0xff0000`

---

### \:get_hsv()

Convert the <Type name="color" /> into three <Type name="number" />s; hue, saturation and value.

#### Example

```lua
local h,s,v = color:get_hsv();
```

---

### \:clone()

Returns a new color with the same components as the original.

#### Example

```lua
local new_color = color:clone();
```
