# Gizmos

Gizmos are useful for drawing stuff for testing your creations. For example, if you call `Gizmo:line` each frame with the points being the start and end of a `Scene:raycast` you're doing, you'll be able to see what's going on Visually.

We will get more than line soon but for now it's all just lines.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error

### \:line()

Draw a line between 2 points. This should be called for each frame the line needs to be rendered.

#### Example
```lua
-- in a component on_update we can do this
function on_update()
    Gizmos:line({
        point_a = vec2(0, 0),
        point_b = vec2(1, 1),
        color = Color:rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.5),
    });
end;
```
