# AssetInstance

You can get assets from a [`require`](/api/require) call. They don't have anything other than a hash for now.

The hash is like the ID of the asset, but if you load the same asset again, it'll have same hash. So, it's an ID, but the same every time.

## Fields

---

### .hash

Hash for the asset
