# `require`

In Simulo, we have the global `require` function. It's available in components and the script box, but NOT directly in tools. To use it in tools, you'll need [`RemoteScene:run`](/api/tools/remotescene).

`require` is what you use to import things like:
- Lua variables or functions
- Assets (images, audio, etc.)
- Components

It can only load things in your Simulo folder. You can either use a relative path (like `./packages/@user/package/...`), or a package path (like `@user/package/...`). You can use either, the only difference is the latter is shorter and cleaner.

```lua
-- You can use a package path like @user/package/... to import
local image = require('@joe/stuff/assets/image.png'); -- resolves to ./packages/@joe/...

-- Or you can use a path relative to the Simulo folder directly:
local audio = require('./objects/my_object/scream.wav');

local texture = require('core/assets/textures/point_light.png');
```
