# core

Simulo comes with a pre-installed package named `core`. You can find it like this:

1. Open Simulo
2. Click **File** ‚Üí **Open Simulo Folder**
3. Go in üìÅ `packages` folder
4. Go in üìÅ `core` folder

All the built-in tools of Simulo (Drag Tool, Box Tool, etc.) are in the `core/tools` folder. Built-in objects, like Simulons, are in `core/objects`.

## Functions

The `core` package contains some functions you can import with [`require`](/api/require).

### bolt

If you add a bolt joint using the `Scene:add_bolt` function, you'll see it works and connects the objects, but there is no visible joint in Simulo. That's because when you use the Bolt Tool, it's adding an [Attachment](/api/Attachment) for you, which manages the bolt joint.

However, the Bolt Tool uses a public `bolt` function which you can import and use yourself in your own scripts. Thus, you can add bolts in the same way as the tool, with a visible joint the user can remove. Here's how to do it:

```lua
local bolt = require('core/lib/bolt.lua'); -- Import bolt function from core package

-- Placeholder objects, you need to put real values!
local object_a = ...;
local object_b = ...;
local point = vec2(0, 0); -- World point to add the bolt

bolt({
    object_a = object_a,
    object_b = object_b,
    point = point,

    sound = true, -- Disable this for silent bolt
    size = 0.3, -- Bolt Tool uses size of 0.3. This controls how large the bolt will look
    color = Color:rgba(1, 1, 1, 0), -- We can set it to be invisible
});
```

It has defaults, and so all you really need is `object_a`, `object_b` and `point`.

### hinge

If you add a hinge joint using the `Scene:add_hinge` function, you'll see it works and connects the objects, but there is no visible joint in Simulo. That's because when you use the Hinge Tool, it's adding an [Attachment](/api/Attachment) for you, which manages the hinge joint.

However, the Hinge Tool uses a public `hinge` function which you can import and use yourself in your own scripts. Thus, you can add hinges in the same way as the tool, with a visible joint the user can remove. Here's how to do it:

```lua
local hinge = require('core/lib/hinge.lua'); -- Import hinge function from core package

-- Placeholder objects, you need to put real values!
local object_a = ...;
local object_b = ...;
local point = vec2(0, 0); -- World point to add the bolt

hinge({
    object_a = object_a,
    object_b = object_b,
    point = point,

    sound = true, -- Disable this for silent hinge
    size = 0.3, -- Hinge Tool uses size of 0.3. This controls how large the hinge will look
    color = Color:rgba(1, 1, 1, 0), -- We can set it to be invisible

    -- These will default to having no motor, you can omit them.
    motor_enabled = true,
    motor_speed = 10,
    max_motor_torque = 10,
    
    -- These also default to being off:
    limit = true,
    lower_limit_angle = 0.2, -- radians
    upper_limit_angle = 0.2,
});
```

It has defaults, and so all you really need is `object_a`, `object_b` and `point`.

### simulon

The Simulo mascot was built from Lua. You can use the `core/lib/simulon.lua` function to spawn your own.

```lua
local simulon = require('core/lib/simulon.lua'); -- Import simulon function from core package

simulon({
    -- All fields have defaults
    position = vec2(0, 0),
    color = Color.SIMULO_GREEN,

    -- We can also specify these:
    -- size = 1,
    -- density = 1,
});
```
