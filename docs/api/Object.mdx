# Object

All objects in a Simulo scene, such as boxes, circles, polygons, etc, are known to the API as <Type name="object" />s.

An <Type name="object" /> reference is typically obtained by:
- Getting it with `Scene:get_object`
- Getting it with `Scene:get_all_objects`
- Using `self` in a [Component](/api/Component/) script

## Fields

---

### .id

Identifier for the object. Is a <Type name="number" />.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
:::

---

### \:destroy()

Destroys the object. This will remove it from the scene and destroy its components.

#### Example

```lua
self:destroy();
```

---

### \:get_linear_velocity()

Returns the linear velocity of the object as a <Type name="vec2" />. Measured in meters per second.

#### Example

```lua
local linvel = self:get_linear_velocity();
```

---

### \:set_linear_velocity()

Sets the linear velocity of the object to a <Type name="vec2" />. Measured in meters per second.

Note that this will not behave realistically. You may want to use [`:apply_force_to_center`](#apply_force_to_center) instead.

#### Example

```lua
self:set_linear_velocity(vec2(1, 1));
```

---

### \:get_angular_velocity()

#### Example

```lua
local angvel = self:get_angular_velocity();
```

---

Applies a force to the center of mass.

#### Example

```lua
self:apply_force_to_center(vec2(1, 1));
```

### \:get_ccd_enabled()

---

### \:get_is_sensor()

---

### \:get_is_awake()

---

### \:get_components()

### \:get_joints()

Gets a list of all the joints attached to the object. You can use `:get_type()` on them to see what kind of joint they are.

---

### \:get_fixed_joints()

Gets a list of all the fixed joints attached to the object.

---

### \:get_collision_layers()

Gets the list of collision layers this object is in.

---

### \:set_collision_layers()

Sets the list of collision layers this object is in.

---

### \:add_component()

Adds a component to the object. It will not be started immediately, but rather remain "sleeping" until the next step when the scene isn't paused. This is so we edit component values in right-click menus before the component is started.

#### Example
```lua
local component = self:add_component({ hash = "<Some hash>" });

local component = self:add_component({
    hash = "<Some hash>",
    -- optionally, we can pass data which it'll get in `on_start`.
    saved_data = {
        some_value = 10,
    },

    -- for Advanced Use we can also give a `properties` table, but its not always a good idea since you need to pass everything about the properties, like the id, name, input_type, value, settings etc
    -- and so if you pass `properties`, you have to set all of them, or they'll be missing
    -- so, if thats not what you want, you should instead do component:set_property after adding the component, like:
    -- ```
    -- local prop = component:get_property("some_property_id");
    -- prop.value = 10;
    -- component:set_property("some_property_id", prop);
    -- ```
});
```

---

### \:get_type()

Returns `"object"`.
