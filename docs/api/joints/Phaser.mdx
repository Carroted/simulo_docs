# Phaser

A phaser prevents collision between two objects.

You can add these with `Scene`'s `add_phaser` indeed. It and `get_phaser` give you something with the below fields and functions.

## Fields

---

### .id

Identifier for the phaser. Is a <Type name="number" />.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
