# Joints

We have 4 types of joints:

## Bolt

These lock all movement between two objects. You'd usually add them with [`core`'s bolt function](/api/core).

## Hinge

These allow rotation between 2 objects, but restrict movement between the joint anchors. You'd usually add them with [`core`'s hinge function](/api/core).

## Fixed Joint

These try to stop movement between two objects, but they do it with a force. The end result is a wobbly connection between the objects. Unlike `bolt` and `hinge`, there is currently no `core` function to add these. You need to use `Scene:add_fixed_joint` for now, which gives you full direct control over the joint.

## Spring

These pull or push objects to have the spring points be at a specified distance from eachother. Unlike `bolt` and `hinge`, there is currently no `core` function to add these. You need to use `Scene:add_spring` for now, which gives you full direct control over the joint.
