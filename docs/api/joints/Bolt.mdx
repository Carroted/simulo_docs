# Bolt

A bolt keeps 2 objects together, and prevents all relative movement or rotation between them. If you instead want a wobbly connection, use [Fixed Joints](/api/joints/FixedJoint).

You can add these with `Scene`'s `add_bolt`, but you are recommended to instead use the [`core` `bolt`](/api/core) function.

If you use `add_bolt`, you'll connect objects, but without a visible bolt attachment the user can remove. For example, the built-in Brush Tool creates brush strokes made of many capsule objects. If you select the result, you won't see any bolts, even invisible ones. Conversely, if you select a Simulon, you'll see some invisible attachments for its spring, bolt, and hinge.

So, if you want to add a visible bolt the user can remove (even if you want it to be invisible), use `core`'s `bolt`. Otherwise, you can use `add_bolt`.

The below functions concern returned bolt joints from `add_bolt`, not `core`'s `bolt`.

## Fields

---

### .id

Identifier for the bolt. Is a <Type name="number" />.

## Functions

:::note
Make sure to use `:function()` and not `.function()`, or you'll get an error
:::

---

### \:destroy()

Destroys the bolt.

---

### \:is_destroyed()

Returns whether or not the bolt still exists.

---

### \:get_object_a()

Gets the first object the bolt is attached to. Can be <Type name="nil" /> if the bolt is connected to the world on that end.

---

### \:get_object_b()

Gets the second object the bolt is attached to. Can be <Type name="nil" /> if the bolt is connected to the world on that end.

---

### \:get_reference_angle()

Difference in angle between the two

---

### \:get_attachment()

Returns the attachment of the bolt as a <Type name="attachment" />. Can be <Type name="nil" />.

---

### \:get_type()

Returns "bolt". Mainly used after `object:get_joints()` to determine what type of joint it is.
