# Mods

We have modding in Lua

Just open Simulo Folder (File -> Open Simulo Folder) and into `mods` folder

Now make a folder of your mod name

Then in there make `src` folder and in there `main.lua`

And wow now you can put umm put this in it right now

```lua
local counter = 0;

function on_update()
    -- Add a window
    Client:window("Counter", {
        -- settings go here
        collapsible = false,
    }, function(ui)
        ui:label("Counter value:", counter);

        ui:horizontal(function(ui)
            if ui:button("Increment"):clicked() then
                counter += 1;
            end;
            if ui:button("Decrement"):clicked() then
                counter -= 1;
            end;
        end);
    end);
end;
```

now save. then go File -> Packages -> Refresh

bam new window appears

## How add thing to bar at bottom,

```lua
function on_update()
    local open, anchor = Client:main_bar_item({
        -- we cant give it an icon or anything yet itll just be a question mark
        -- but dammit i need release this today.

        -- so i guess, nothing here, at all
    });

    if open then
        Client:window("My Menu", {
            anchor = anchor, -- use anchor it gave us
            title_bar = false,
            resizable = false,
            collapsible = false,
        }, function(ui)
            ui:heading("My Menu");
            ui:separator();
            ui:label("Fr\nThis is my real menu");
        end);
    end;
end;
```

now, i know what you must be thinking now. how do i add cool stuff in my UI? well STOP IT RAHH we have another page for that. UI page

but anyway mods have DIRECT access to `Scene` BUT its `nil` on non-host in multiplayer so be so very carefuls fr. you can thus check if gamer is the host and you can hide your host-only windows
